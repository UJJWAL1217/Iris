I have explored Many domains of the computer science till now and applied the knowledge  to develop products . I have done my Major Project In the domain of Artificial Intelligence  . The main idea is to develop a Voice Assistance with some new useful features . I have created a voice assistance which takes voice input and work accordingly . I found that the currently used voice assistance is lagging some features and situations which should be considered . My assistance fulfill that lagging  features . I have implemented 4 new features along with the existing features .  1. Gesture Controls -> for this feature we have to give the voice command to activate the gesture control for example "Volume Control" . To implemented this I have selected the domain computer vision which  is the part of Artificial intelligence which automate the camera and reduce the use of sensors . I have  used openCV which uses the camera  to detect the gesture . The idea to control the volume using and hand gesture is accomplished by making the distance between the index finger and the thumb directly proportional  to the volume of the device . We can control the volume of the device by gesture. We can Implement such new gesture control features to help the disabled or  blind to control their device and also can extend this to understand what the blind or dumb person is trying to convey . 2. SOS feature -> This is an emergency features which is inbuilt in the mobile phones which activates when when we press some buttons frequently . But my thought is that what  if someone snatches the phone before you press the emergency button . So here to overcome this I have use voice command to awake the emergency features . The command to awake can be kept secret and only known to the user who set that . So on Utterance of that command the Assistance will send the whatsapp message to the family number which is also set by the user himself . The assistance will also send the longitudinal and the latitudinal location to that number along with the location link and time of incident . so this feature is new in my assistance . 3. Security Camera -> we can give voice command and activate the security camera . If some moments happens in front of it  then an alarm will start which make the user aware that some one is entered in their secured region or someone try to go near to their device 4. Sentiment analysis -> This is the application of the machine learning in which i have used a module which contains different voice according to different mood . I have used this module as a training set for the model . The assistance listen the user and predict the mood and perform some tasks in order to make the mood of the person good or more happy or greet for the achievement. 5. I have automated the whatsapp means we can send the whatsapp message through voice commands . All will be done through voice commands . I have implemented this new feature in an assistance along with the existing tasks that current assistance can do .
